# ChangeAppIcon

From iOS 10.3 and above â€“ Apple allows to change app icons runtime.

![This is the sample GIF showing app icon changes.](https://github.com/hemangshah/ChangeAppIcon/blob/master/Source/ChangeAppIcon/Screenshots/ChangeAppIcon.gif)

I have written an [article](https://ikiwitech.com/2017/05/08/change-your-ios-application-icons-runtime/) for the same.

All the icons, Mumbai, New York, Sydney and London has been downloaded from [Flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com). Please read the [ThankYou.pdf](https://github.com/hemangshah/ChangeAppIcon/blob/master/Source/ChangeAppIcon/ThankYou.pdf) for the attribution.
